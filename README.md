# AI&Machine learning club workshop : Squidgame
This repository contains the code used to run the game for the AI & Machine Learning Club, which my team and I hosted. The game is inspired by Squid Game and serves as an interactive learning experience where club members build and test their own classification models.

During the event, we replace the default model in this program with each member's custom model, allowing them to see whether their classification model functions correctly within the game environment. This hands-on approach provides an engaging way for participants to apply machine learning concepts and test their models in real-time.
